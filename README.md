Easy Explore - Advanced OOP Course Project

Easy Explore is an application built using Java and Scene Builder as part of an advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. This project integrates game-like mechanics to encourage users to explore and discover new places in their town.

Features
1. Account Creation: Users can create their own accounts and start their journey of exploring the town.

2. Discover & Explore:

Users (Explorers) can discover new places in their town.
Discovered places are submitted for validation by the admin. Upon approval, the place is added to the list of official locations.
For every validated discovery, the Explorer earns 70 experience points.

3. Blog Feature:

Users can create blogs about the places they've discovered.
Blogs can be liked or disliked by other users.
For every like, the user earns 3 experience points. For every dislike, the user loses 3 experience points.

4. Local Transaction Routes:

Users can discover and add local transaction routes (such as vehicle routes) to places.
The admin validates the routes, and if approved, the user earns 30 experience points.
Badges:

For every 100 experience points, users receive badges such as:
1. Pathfinder
2. Trailblazer
   
5. Admin Role
   
The admin validates all discovered places and transaction routes to ensure accuracy before adding them to the town's official map.
